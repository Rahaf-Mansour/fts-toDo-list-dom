# TODO List 
A TODO List web application with various features to manage tasks efficiently, it was built with a user-friendly interface that allows users to add, update, and remove TODO items.
 The application also interacts with a dummy API to retrieve the initial TODO list and contains local storage.

## App Features:
1. Retrieve the TODO list from a dummy API.
2. Add new TODO.
3. Delete TODO.
4. Mark TODO as done.
5. Count the number of TODOs in the footer.
6. Search for TODOs.
7. Data are stored in the browser to persist across page refreshes.
8. A simple, user-friendly interface.
